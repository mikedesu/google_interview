# google interview preparations

I am just free-flowing it.

Doing Python3 for my interview.

I am realizing this might build into something later so I am just going with it.

Dude named "TechLead" over at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIrS31CCITM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIrS31CCITM) be like:

> Learn you stacks, queues, and hashmaps

So I'm like "Ok".

```
test1.py - How to use lists, list as a stack, list as a queue
```

All of this is taken from: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

Right now I'm like "...should I add more to test1.py? Nah lets take list comprehensions to test2.py" so I'm like "ok".

```
test2.py - List comprehensions
test3.py - Nested List comprehensions, matrix transpose, list(zip(*matrix))
test4.py - del keyword on lists
test5.py - tuples
```
